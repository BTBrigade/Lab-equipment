This is an assembly used to make linear sucrose gradients much like the system BioComp sells. 
The assembly is 5 pieces, the rack top (1), supports (3), and rack bottom (1).
It is assembled with M2.5 screws (6) and a magnet (1) secured by an M4 X 20 bolt and washer. 
The current version relies on drilling a hole in the bottom rack, but can be easily ammended to print the hole.
